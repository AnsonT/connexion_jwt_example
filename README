Readme:

1 - Install all the dependencies
	* flask_jwt mainly at this point
2 - Execute in the command line:
	> python -c 'import run; run.start_stuff()'

3 - Execute in the command line:
	> curl -POST http://localhost:9878/auth -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"username":"user1", "password": "abcxyz"}'

	You will get a __KEY__.

Now try:

	curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://localhost:9878/api/stuff'

You should get a 401 error

But if you do (replace __KEY__ with your key)

	curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'Authorization: JWT __KEY__' 'http://localhost:9878/api/stuff'

you should get some good good sugar. +, you'll get the user in the console. 


Have fun :)
